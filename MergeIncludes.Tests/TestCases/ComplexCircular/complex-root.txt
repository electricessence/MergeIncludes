# Complex Root File with Repeated References
This demonstrates a complex include structure with repeated dependencies.

## Include from same directory
#include ./local.txt

## Include SubFolder1 component (which has its own dependencies)
#include ./SubFolder1/component1.txt

## Include SubFolder2 component (which also has dependencies)
#include ./SubFolder2/component2.txt

## Direct include of common.txt (repeated reference)
#include ./SubFolder2/common.txt

## Another direct include of subcomponent1.txt (repeated reference)
#include ./SubFolder1/subcomponent1.txt

## Include from external folder
#include ../AnotherFolder/external.txt

## Include local.txt again (repeated reference)
#include ./local.txt

## End of complex root file
