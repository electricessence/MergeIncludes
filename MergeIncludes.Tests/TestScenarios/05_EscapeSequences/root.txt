# Escape Sequences Test

This file tests the escape sequence functionality.

## Escaped Directives (should appear as literal text):

Plain text escape:
##include ./should-be-literal.txt

JavaScript style escape:
// ##include ./should-be-literal.js

HTML style escape:
<!-- ##include ./should-be-literal.html -->

YAML/Config style escape:
# ##require ./should-be-literal.yml

## Normal Directives (should be processed):

This will include actual content:
#include ./content.txt
