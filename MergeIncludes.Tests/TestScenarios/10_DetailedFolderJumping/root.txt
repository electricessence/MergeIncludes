# Test file for folder jumping between different directories
// First include from SubFolder1
#include ../Shared/SubFolder1/file1.txt
// Then include from SubFolder2  
#include ../Shared/SubFolder2/file2.txt
// Jump back to SubFolder1 (should relist the folder)
#include ../Shared/SubFolder1/file3.txt
// Jump to MainFolder (root)
#include ../Shared/file4.txt
// Jump back to SubFolder2 (should relist the folder)
#include ../Shared/SubFolder2/file5.txt
// Jump back to MainFolder again
#include ../Shared/file6.txt
